This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Clone entire project:
    - `git clone https://github.com/dallasboyer/readable-2.git`

## Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

## In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

App should now be running at `localhost:3001`
